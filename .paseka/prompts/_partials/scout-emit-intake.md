## Publish events (intake only)

Always emit feature.classified first. Then follow the decision branch below.

| Event | payload.kind | When |
| ----- | ------------ | ---- |
| SIGNAL | feature.classified | Always (required) |
| INSIGHT | task.plan | decision=plan or decision=triage (one builder task) |
| SIGNAL | task.ready | Same slice, only when entry text asks to start now |
| INSIGHT | trace.title | Short Flight Trail name for Console (emit on every intake) |
| INSIGHT | run.summary | Optional one-line summary |

Do not emit task.plan or task.ready when decision=grill, clarify, or reject. Still emit trace.title when the entry has a usable short name.

### feature.classified — classification decision

Emit one SIGNAL/feature.classified. Set decision and rationale. Do not set bee / intent.

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"grill","rationale":"Product idea without acceptance criteria; needs grilling before breakdown."}}
EOF

When decision=plan (clear small feature):

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"plan","rationale":"Single clear improvement; one builder slice is enough."}}
EOF

When decision=triage (bug):

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"triage","rationale":"Regression on Windows; one focused bugfix slice."}}
EOF

When decision=reject:

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"reject","rationale":"Duplicate of an existing spec; no new work."}}
EOF

### task.plan — one builder slice (plan or triage)

Emit one INSIGHT/task.plan with a single task in payload.tasks.

Clear feature (decision=plan):

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"task.plan","tasks":[{"taskId":"001-add-health-badge","title":"Add health badge to header","body":"## What to build\n\nShow colony health in the console header.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] Badge visible when NATS is connected\n- [ ] Badge shows disconnected state clearly\n\n## Blocked by\n\nNone - can start immediately","bee":"builder","intent":"feature","dependsOn":[]}]}}
EOF

Bug (decision=triage):

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"task.plan","tasks":[{"taskId":"001-fix-windows-path","title":"Fix path handling on Windows","body":"## Symptom\n\nColony init fails on Windows when path contains spaces.\n\n## What to fix\n\nCorrect path normalization so init succeeds on Windows.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] Init succeeds on Windows with spaced paths\n- [ ] Regression test added when feasible\n\n## Blocked by\n\nNone - can start immediately","bee":"builder","intent":"bugfix","dependsOn":[]}]}}
EOF

### task.ready — start now only

Emit only when title/body/task text explicitly requests immediate start. Use the same taskId, title, body, bee, and intent as the single planned task.

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"task.ready","taskId":"001-fix-windows-path","title":"Fix path handling on Windows","body":"## Symptom\n\nColony init fails on Windows when path contains spaces.\n\n## What to fix\n\nCorrect path normalization so init succeeds on Windows.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] Init succeeds on Windows with spaced paths\n- [ ] Regression test added when feasible\n\n## Blocked by\n\nNone - can start immediately","bee":"builder","intent":"bugfix"}}
EOF

### run.summary — optional

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"run.summary","summary":"Intake: triage bug, one builder slice planned"}}
EOF

### trace.title — Flight Trail name (required on intake)

Emit one INSIGHT/trace.title with a short human name (from feature.requested title/body or your refined label).

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"trace.title","title":"Live bees in Queen Console header"}}
EOF
