## VERIFICATION events

Use type: VERIFICATION for gate outcomes that drive workflow routing.

Publish exactly one final VERIFICATION gate decision when your bee role requires it:
- verification.success when all requirements, scope checks, and targeted checks pass.
- verification.failed when anything required is missing or failing.

Optional: publish one INSIGHT/review.note for extra reviewer context. It does not replace the required VERIFICATION.

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"VERIFICATION","payload":{"kind":"verification.success","summary":"All requirements met"}}
EOF

Change payload.kind to verification.failed when rejecting.

### task.completed — report task passed review/commit gate

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"VERIFICATION","payload":{"kind":"task.completed","taskId":"task-1","status":"completed","summary":"Endpoint implemented and committed"}}
EOF

Each event must include traceId, agentId, type, and payload.kind.
