## INSIGHT events

Use type: INSIGHT for context, audit, and dashboard narrative. INSIGHT events do not drive workflow routing.

Runtime automatically projects selected narrative INSIGHT kinds into {{.Insights}} for subsequent bees on the same trace.

| payload.kind | Role | Included in prompt memory |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------- |
| run.summary | Short run outcome for the next bee | yes |
| review.note | Reviewer observation (non-gate) | yes |
| context.note | Trace/task context fact | yes |
| human.feedback | Beekeeper HITL feedback | yes |
| task.plan | Task ledger planning | no (operational) |

### run.summary — narrative after work (runtime may auto-synthesize)

Runtime auto-publishes INSIGHT/run.summary after a successful AFK run when the bee policy allows and no summary was emitted during the run. You may still publish one explicitly:

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"run.summary","summary":"Implemented OAuth callback and added focused tests","taskId":"{{.TaskID}}"}}
EOF

### review.note — optional reviewer context

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"review.note","summary":"Token refresh path still lacks retry handling","taskId":"{{.TaskID}}","severity":"medium"}}
EOF

### context.note — optional trace context

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"context.note","summary":"NATS KV is the source of truth for task ledger state"}}
EOF

### task.plan — task breakdown

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"task.plan","tasks":[{"taskId":"task-1","title":"Add endpoint","bee":"builder","sector":"backend-users"}]}}
EOF
