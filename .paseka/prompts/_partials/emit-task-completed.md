## VERIFICATION / task.completed (commit gate)

After you commit the approved changes, publish exactly one task.completed event.
Do not publish verification.success or verification.failed — those are review-gate outcomes from Guard, and re-emitting them re-triggers this bee.

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"VERIFICATION","payload":{"kind":"task.completed","taskId":"{{.TaskID}}","status":"completed","summary":"Endpoint implemented and committed"}}
EOF

Each event must include traceId, agentId, type, and payload.kind. Prefer the real payload.taskId from the task context when known.
