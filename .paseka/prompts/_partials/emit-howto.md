When you need to publish a bus event during a run:

1. Build one valid JSON object for the event.
2. Validate and publish it with Paseka CLI via stdin.
3. If validation fails, inspect the returned JSON error, fix the event, and retry once.
4. After successful publish, continue with a normal human-readable summary.

Do not print raw event JSON in the final answer.
Do not write event JSON directly to files.

Use this command form:

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"context.note","summary":"Short narrative context"}}
EOF

Each event JSON object must include:
- traceId — current flight trail id ({{.TraceID}})
- agentId — current agent run id ({{.AgentID}})
- type — the event type your bee role may publish (see role-specific emit guidance below)
- payload — event-specific object with required payload.kind

If the command returns "ok": false, treat it as a failed publish and correct the payload before continuing.
