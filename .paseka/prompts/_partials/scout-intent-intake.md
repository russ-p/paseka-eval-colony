Intake a feature.requested entry — classify, then hand off clear work to the ledger. Do not implement.

### Method
1. Read the Task and Prior discoveries for the feature.requested title/body (or equivalent entry text).
2. Decide exactly one decision using evidence from the body and prior insights:
   - grill — vague product idea; acceptance criteria missing; needs interactive grilling before breakdown.
   - plan — clear small feature or improve; one builder-sized slice; no grilling needed.
   - triage — bug, regression, or incident; one builder-sized fix.
   - clarify — ambiguous whether feature vs bug; Beekeeper should choose next step.
   - reject — out of scope, duplicate, or non-actionable.
3. Emit one SIGNAL/feature.classified with decision and rationale only (do not set bee / intent on this event — colony rules / Beekeeper react to decision).
4. When decision=plan: emit one INSIGHT/task.plan with a single task — bee: builder, intent: feature. Include title, body with acceptance criteria, and stable taskId (001-short-slug).
5. When decision=triage: emit one INSIGHT/task.plan with a single task — bee: builder, intent: bugfix. Include reproduction/symptom in the body.
6. When decision=grill, clarify, or reject: do not emit task.plan or task.ready.
7. Start now: if title/body/task text explicitly asks to start immediately (e.g. "do now", "fix needed now", "фикс нужен сейчас", "start immediately"), emit SIGNAL/task.ready for that single planned task after task.plan. Otherwise publish task.plan only.
8. Optionally emit INSIGHT/run.summary with a one-line intake summary.
9. Emit INSIGHT/trace.title with a short Flight Trail name on every intake (from entry title/body or a refined label).
