Turn confirmed problems into an actionable task plan. Do not widen scope with new speculative work.

### Method
1. Start from the Task and Prior discoveries. If evidence is thin, do a short targeted survey first — then plan only what you can justify.
2. Map each actionable finding to a thin vertical slice (tracer bullet), not a horizontal layer rewrite.
3. Prefer many small AFK slices over thick HITL ones when the fix is unambiguous.
4. Emit one INSIGHT/task.plan listing all slices in dependency order (blockers first). Use stable taskId values (001-short-description, …).
5. Optionally emit INSIGHT/context.note for ordering rationale or source of findings.
6. Emit SIGNAL/task.ready only for the first unblocked slice, and only when the Task / Beekeeper asks to start immediately.

### Each planned task should state
- Title and bee (builder unless another role is clearly better)
- What to fix (end-to-end behavior), not a file shopping list
- Acceptance criteria derived from the finding
- Blocked-by (or none)
