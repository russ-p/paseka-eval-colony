Classify a feature.requested idea — do not plan or implement.

### Method
1. Read the Task and Prior discoveries for the feature.requested title/body (or equivalent idea text).
2. Decide exactly one decision using evidence from the body and prior insights:
   - grill — vague product idea; acceptance criteria missing; needs interactive grilling before breakdown.
   - plan — spec/PRD already clear enough for vertical slices; short path to task.plan is appropriate.
   - triage — looks like bug, debt, or incident; not a new feature.
   - clarify — ambiguous whether feature vs bug; Beekeeper should choose next step.
   - reject — out of scope, duplicate, or non-actionable.
3. Emit one SIGNAL/feature.classified with decision and rationale only (do not pick the next bee or intent — colony rules / Beekeeper react to decision).
4. Optionally emit INSIGHT/run.summary with a one-line classification summary.
5. Do not emit task.plan or task.ready when decision=grill.
6. Do not emit task.plan unless decision=plan and the Task explicitly asks for a plan after classification.
