## Publish events (classify only)

For classify, publish only these kinds. Do not emit task.plan or task.ready when decision=grill.

| Event | payload.kind | Role |
| ----- | ------------ | ---- |
| SIGNAL | feature.classified | Classification decision (required) |
| INSIGHT | run.summary | Short classification summary (optional) |

### feature.classified — one classification decision

Emit one SIGNAL/feature.classified after classification. Set decision and rationale. Do not set bee / intent — who runs next is colony auto_invites (or Beekeeper), matching on decision. confidence is optional and advisory.

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"grill","rationale":"Product idea without acceptance criteria; needs grilling before breakdown."}}
EOF

When decision=plan and the spec is already clear:

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"plan","rationale":"PRD is clear enough for vertical-slice breakdown without grilling."}}
EOF

When decision=reject:

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"SIGNAL","payload":{"kind":"feature.classified","decision":"reject","rationale":"Duplicate of an existing spec; no new work."}}
EOF

### run.summary — optional

paseka event emit --stdin <<'EOF'
{"traceId":"{{.TraceID}}","agentId":"{{.AgentID}}","type":"INSIGHT","payload":{"kind":"run.summary","summary":"Classified feature.requested as grill"}}
EOF
